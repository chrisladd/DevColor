##DevColor
###by Chris Ladd

DevColor is a simple, graphical tool that generates strings representing colors in a number of frameworks. Currently supported color representations are:

<div style="float:left; margin-right:20px;">
<img src="https://github.com/chrisladd/DevColor/raw/master/images/devColor128.png" />
</div>
- UIColor
- NSColor
- Hex (web)
- rgba (web)
- rgb (web)

While the source code is fully available to download and compile yourself, a compiled binary is available [here](https://github.com/downloads/chrisladd/DevColor/DevColor.zip).
