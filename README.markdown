###Simple Color Strings by Chris Ladd

DevColor is a simple, graphical tool created with a single goal: to make my life as an iOS, Mac and web developer better.  For the past several months I've been using DevColor every day as a lightweight tool to generate color-representing strings in a variety of formats. Now you can too.

The DevColor interface is a simple panel:

Just click the large color well to bring up the color panel:

Currently supported color representations are:

- UIColor

- NSColor

- Hex (web)

- rgba (web)
>![RGBA](https://github.com/chrisladd/DevColor/raw/master/images/RGBAColorSnippet.png)

- rgb (web)
>![RGB](https://github.com/chrisladd/DevColor/raw/master/images/RGBSnippet.png)



Choose a color, then copy it to your clipboard:

While the source code is fully available to download and compile yourself, a compiled binary is available [here](https://github.com/downloads/chrisladd/DevColor/DevColor.zip). 

I've benefitted a great deal from the generosity of others as I continue to grow as a developer. DevColor is a small way of giving back.

If you like DevColor, check out some of my other projects on my website at [http://www.ladditude.com](http://www.ladditude.com). Or you can check out my [iOS apps on the iTunes app store](http://itunes.com/apps/walksoft). Or you can follow me on Twitter at @chrisladd. Or you can buy me a beer at WWDC -- he'll be there.

Hope you like it, and please, let me know what you think.
