<h1>DevColor</h1>

###by Chris Ladd

DevColor is a simple, graphical tool that generates strings representing colors in a number of frameworks. The goal is to make choosing colors as painless as possible. The DevColor interface is a simple panel:

Currently supported color representations are:

- UIColor
- NSColor
- Hex (web)
- rgba (web)
- rgb (web)

Just click the large color well to bring up the color panel:

Choose a color, then copy it to your clipboard:

While the source code is fully available to download and compile yourself, a compiled binary is available [here](https://github.com/downloads/chrisladd/DevColor/DevColor.zip).
